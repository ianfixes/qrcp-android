# QRCP for Android

This project was inspired by [qrcp](https://github.com/claudiodangelis/qrcp), and works in an identical way: a file selected for sharing is served by HTTP over the local network, using a URL that is shown in a QR code; when the file is downloaded, the server automatically stops.
